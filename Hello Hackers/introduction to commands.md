I read the pwn.college portal for information on the basics of how to use the prompt.
Executed how to capture and show flags after connecting the module to ubuntu.
Learnt about the arguments echo and hello used in ubuntu.
Followed the remaining steps and submitted the received flags.
```bash
hacker@hello~intro-to-arguments:~$ hello hackers
Success! Here is your flag:
pwn.college{I_cQgPV5u5B_uuIccqKo9fnqb-2.dhjNyUDLyczN1czW}
hacker@hello~intro-to-arguments:~$
```
