Challenge 1-
Learnt about how files work, their pathing, with a tree comparision. 
Invoked pwn program using its absolute path, and captured its flag.
```
bash
hacker@paths~the-root:~$ /pwn
BOOM!!!
Here is your flag:
pwn.college{87ftlFg5aO7BdQHNTbKYYnYZzrj.dhzN5QDLyczN1czW}
```
Challenge 2-
Learnt how to access challenges through file paths. This challenge was available by executing /challenge/run command to obtain the flag.
Initially thought the root /pwn was still in consideration
```bash
hacker@paths~program-and-absolute-paths:~$ /pwn/challenge/run
ssh-entrypoint: /pwn/challenge/run: No such file or directory
hacker@paths~program-and-absolute-paths:~$ /challenge/run
Correct!!!
/challenge/run is an absolute path! Here is your flag:
pwn.college{Al4UKb2sT_YJhy0-1ecOEQHVKDT.dVDN1QDLyczN1czW}
```
