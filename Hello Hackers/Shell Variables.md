# This module teaches about variables, (shell variables).
# Challenge 1
The /challenge/run program wasnt allowed to give us the flag here. The flag was put in a variable named "FLAG".
We had to print the contents of the variable FLAG. 
This could be done using "echo" which is a basic printing command.
If we are printing variables using echo, the syntax asks us to use a $ sign infront of it, to notify to the computer that its a variable and not just a word to be echoed.
```bash
hacker@variables~printing-variables:~$ echo $FLAG
pwn.college{s6XdEjQfzVzbcnO2ahZDUsblAQI.ddTN1QDLyczN1czW}
```
